There will be a final project, including a computer implementation of a user interface using commonsense knowledge, and a paper describing your implementation. You may work either alone, or in groups of up to three people. You may use any computer system and programming language you wish. A one-page project proposal will be required before the project starts. The paper should be in the style of a short paper for CHI or other academic conference. One or more members of each group will give a 15-20 min presentation of the project, again, in the style of a short conference paper.

The following are example student projects from 2002. All work is courtesy of the students named and used with permission.
